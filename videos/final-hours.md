## Description
Series of videos related to the server closure at the end of 2011. [0] wanted everyone to forget about the project and wipe it from the web, so a lot of the files and videos that got uploaded to YouTube did not stay up for long. That link in the description mentioned in the tutorial was gone within less than 3 days.

If it wasn't for us, this project would probably never go "public" at all, even if only for a short time and to a smaller community. I feel like a lot of the decisions he made (like keeping everything private until everything was done) were completely due to his insecurities, which ultimately made him shut everything down, further fueled by the fact that by this point 1.0.0 had been released, while he was still stuck with the alpha codebase.
 
Even if the rest of the team wasn't on the best terms with him, we still wanted this project to go somewhere, and so did the community.

### Video 4
This video is a memorial of 16.05.

Nothing really special here.

### Video 6
This video showcases a way to emulate the servers for 16.05, allowing the game to be played again.

(20:26) The person recording tries to go to the 16.05 website, only to be met with the message: ``Extension 16.05 is suspended indefinitely. No further support will be available. No point wasting my time anyway. Have fun playing the actual game.``

(20:32) This video appears to take place 2 years after the shutdown, as is mentioned by text on screen.
